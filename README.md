email address per service which cannot be guessed and can be recreated easily, if necessary.

## Usage

This service is available as a Docker image, so you can get up and running in just a minute. The image is available
at `ghcr.io/tinyoverflow/catchall-address-generator:latest`. All tags can be found at
the [GitHub container registry](https://github.com/tinyoverflow/catchall-address-generator/pkgs/container/catchall-address-generator)
.

While this container does not require any additional dependencies or port mappings, it requires the configuration of
some environment variables to work properly.
